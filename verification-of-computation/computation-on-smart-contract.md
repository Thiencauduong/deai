# Computation on Smart Contract

Ethereum offers smart contract functionality that is theoretically proven to be Turing complete. This has sparked interest in leveraging smart contracts for AI computations. However, the practicality of utilizing smart contracts for AI computations is limited by the substantial gas costs associated with such operations, rendering them impractical for handling large models.
